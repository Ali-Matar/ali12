        <p><b>The Applications of Artificial Intelligence and ML in Business</b><br>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Chatbots</b> <br>Artificial intelligence continues to be a hot topic in the technology space
                     as well as increasing its inception into other realms such as healthcare, business, and gaming<br>
                    . AI-powered chatbots in enterprises will also see an influx of people get more comfortable with how AI
                     can actually benefit businesses versus, say, take away their jobs<br>. From an analytical standpoint, 
                    AI can be incorporated into interfaces to change how they receive and understand data.<br>

                    Chatbots, in particular, are always on, delivering smart and flexible analytics through conversations on
                     mobile devices using standard messaging tools and voice-activated interfaces<br>
                    .This dramatically reduces the time to collect data for all business users, thereby accelerating the pace
                     of business and streamlines the way analysts use their time<br>,
                     preparing companies for the growing data needs of the near future.

                    <li><b>Artificial Intelligence in Commerce</b><br> Artificial Intelligence technology provides a competitive
                         edge to e-commerce businesses and is becoming readily available to companies of any size or budget<br>.
                         Leveraging machine learning, AI software automatically tags, organizes and visually searches content by
                          labeling features of the image or video.<br>

                        AI is enabling shoppers to discover associated products whether it is size, color, shape, or even brand.
                         The visual capabilities AI is improving every year<br>. By first obtaining visual cues from the uploaded imagery,
                         the software can successfully assist the customer in finding the product they desire.<br> Many e-commerce
                          retailers are already becoming more sophisticated with their AI capabilities, and I only expect this to grow in the future.<br>

                        <li><b> AI to Improve Workplace Communication:</b><br>Current business communication is overloaded 
                            with content, channels, tools, and so-called solutions, depriving individuals (and companies) from hitting targets<br>
                             while also harming work-life balanceArtificial Intelligence will help businesses improve
                              communication internally and externally by enabling individual personalization<br> 
                              for each professional, allowing for enhanced focus and increased productivity.
                            With such AI personalization, each individual will be empowered thanks to
                             an intelligent virtual assistant, <br>helping take care of mundane or
                              repeatable tasks, save time by understanding your needs and goals, as well as recommend 
                            action to take…as to utilize time much more efficiently,<br> without requiring any extra effort.
                             In the short to long run business processes will improve, innovation will grow as employees
                              will clear their tasks, and stress may decrease.

                        <li><b>Human Resource Management</b><br>
                            AI and Machine learning are going to drastically and irrevocably change how HR and recruitment
                             work in every company and this is going to be awesome. In fact,<br> HR is likely to be one of
                              the first areas of business that will benefit from AI for two simple reasons.
                             Firstly there are tons of top quality data in HR, and secondly,<br> HR is one part of any
                              company that is both essential and yet feels the pressure of time.AI help to achive the development

                        <li><b> AI in Healthcare:</b><br>
                            In the year ahead, and particularly in the next five to ten years, artificial intelligence 
                            is going to have a big impact on the healthcare industry and the ways in which<br> healthcarerelated 
                            companies utilize AI
                            . Here is a short note from Dr. Jeff Dunn,
                             CEO of Redivus Health. Redivus Health is a transformative mobile app used by healthcare<br> providers 
                             to prevent medical errors by offering both clinical decision support during critical medical events as
                              well as documenting those events 
                             electronically in real time.

                        <li><b> Intelligent Cybersecurity </b><br>
                            In regard to cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence is making great strides. Although AI is 
                            considered to be in its infancy in cybersecurity and cannot always effectively <br>address all issues,
                             it works successfully in data protection. AI allows companies to detect vulnerabilities or 
                             anomalous user behavior in such business applications <br>as ERP or Financial systems.
                            A system of behavior anomalies analysis in computer systems resembles the world’s most protected 
                            airport: when you are on the way to it, <br>the security system has enough time to analyze your
                             identity; you are examined by cameras and in case of any signs of danger, you are intercepted.<br>
                              Deep learning is empowered to see if a user has any suspicious activity. So, even if attackers 
                             have penetrated into a victim’s system,<br> they start taking actions that differ from the usual 
                             ones and as a result, they do not leave unnoticed and their damage is prevented

                        <li><b> Artificial Intelligence in Logistics and Supply Chain:</b><br>
                            When combined with customer data and analytics,<br> physical artificial intelligence removes
                            
                            friction from the customer experience.
                        Artificial intelligence empowers businesses to act on consumer data to drive <br>improvements
                             throughout many areas of supply chain operations. Mobile technology and the “Uberization” of
                              things have made consumers hungry for AI<br>.

                            Consumers demand shorter delivery waits from retailers and retailers will expect the same from 
                            manufacturers and distribution centers. Autonomous trucks<br> and robotic picking systems allow
                             supply chains to make fulfillment seven days a week.


                             Within the next five years, the shipping term<br> “business days” will become obsolete as consumers
                              expect delivery on nights and weekends.
