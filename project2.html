    </p><b>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
    </b><br> The field of AI refers to developing computer systems that use big sets of data to perform “intelligent” tasks: think visual perception<br>
    , understanding natural language, reasoning and decision making. Machine learning is one way of building such systems based on providing 
    <br>the computer with examples of what it should do, and let it figure out (learn) how to do it.

    AI entered the scene of computer science in the early 1950s<br> when computers started learning checkers strategies and speaking English.
    
    Since then the field has made remarkable progress. With faster <br>and more powerful computers, access to larger amounts of data and algorithm improvements, AI systems have taken off.

<b>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF AI?
</b><br>
At a very high level, artificial intelligence can be split into two broad types: narrow AI and general AI.As mentioned above,<br>
 narrow AI is what we see all around us in computers today:intelligent systems thathave been taught or have learned<br>
  how to carry out specific tasks without being explicitly programmed how to do so.This type of machine intelligence is evident<br>
 in the speech and language recognition of the Siri virtual assistant on the Apple iPhone,in the vision-recognition systems on self-driving <br>
cars, or in the recommendation engines that suggest products you might like based on what you bought in the past Unlike humans,<br>
   these systems can only learn or be taught how to do defined tasks, which is why they are called narrow AI<br>
