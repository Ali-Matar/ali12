<p><b>How AI Works & What It Does
</b><br>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is programmed with machine learning and deep learning<br>
, two of the known subsets or techniques of artificial intelligence. In simple terms, Artificial Intelligence is 
an area of computer science, but it’s not as straightforward as it sounds
.<br> It definitely is a computer system, but it’s a computer system that simulates human behavior
 focusing on humans thought process, logical thinking, and rational acting.
 <br> Moreover, how AI works is through improvising to perform tasks and to deal with unfamiliar scenarios.

        <p>A common AI application that we see today is the automatic switching of appliances at home.

            When you enter a dark room<br>, the sensors in the room detect your presence and turn on the lights.
             This is an example of non-memory machines. Some of the more advanced<br> AI programs are even able to predict 
             your usage pattern and turn on appliances before you explicitly give instructions.<br> 
            
            Some AI programs are able to identify your voice and perform an action accordingly. If you say,
             “turn on the TV”,<br> the sound sensors on the TV detect your voice and turn it on. 
            
            With the Google dongle and a Google Home Mini, you can actually do this every day.<br>
